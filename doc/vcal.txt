Settings:

    The g:Vcalfile variable needs to be set to the file you want to use for 
    storing the dates.

    The g:Vcaluser variable needs to be set to the user name for the calendar.


Setting appointments:

  If no time is given when setting an appointment the current time is used.

  Setting of dates like the American Thanksgiving holiday, the fourth Thursday
	in November, is done with a monthly repeat instead of a yearly repeat.

  Complex dates such as Easter must be done from within the script.  See 
  the EasterSunday() and the BoxingDay() in the script for examples.
