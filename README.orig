Do not use this script with any vcf file that you don't want to be destroyed.
If you want to use this with a current vcf file, make a copy of the file and 
use the copy.

When the vcf file is written, several of the fields are filled with 
dummy info that may cause the file to be unuseable with other calendar programs.


Installation:

	Move the vcal.vim script to either the system wide vim plugin directory or 
	to ~/.vim/plugin.  Move the vcal.txt file to either the system wide vim 
	doc directory or to ~/.vim/doc.  Start vim and enter
	:helptags ~/.vim/doc  or :helptags /your/system/wide/vim60/doc
